## Training Your Chatbot

The chatbot's knowledge comes entirely from content you provide. You can train it from four different sources, all accessible under **Chatbot → Training** in the Control Panel.

### Craft Entries

Train the chatbot on your existing Craft CMS content in just a few clicks.

- Select which **sections** the chatbot should learn from
- Click **"Train now"** to index all entries from the selected sections
- Each entry is split into chunks and stored as vector embeddings
- A table shows every indexed entry with its chunk count and last training date
- Individual entries can be re-trained or removed from the index
- Click into an entry to **inspect its chunks** and see exactly what the AI knows

### File Upload

Upload plain-text documents directly to the training index.

- Supports `.txt` and `.md` files (max 5 MB each)
- Drag-and-drop or click to browse
- Files are indexed immediately after upload
- Manage uploaded files in a table: re-index or delete individual files

### URL / Sitemap Training

Point the chatbot at any public webpage or import an entire sitemap at once.

- Paste a **sitemap XML URL** to automatically discover and import all pages
- Or enter **individual URLs** manually (one per line)
- Click **"Crawl all & index"** to process all queued URLs
- Each URL shows a status badge: `pending`, `indexed`, or `error`
- Click into a URL to inspect its extracted chunks
- Re-crawl or delete individual URLs at any time

### Q&A Training

Define exact question-and-answer pairs to give the chatbot precise, reliable responses to common questions.

- Add pairs manually via a simple form (question + answer)
- Or **import directly from Chat Logs** - turn any real bot response into a training pair with one click
- Toggle pairs active / inactive without deleting them
- Pairs show their source: `Manual` or `Log`
- Saved pairs are immediately indexed and available to the chatbot

---

## Dashboard

The Dashboard gives you a live overview of how your chatbot is being used and what it knows.

### Conversation Statistics

- **Total Conversations** - number of chat sessions
- **Total Messages** - all messages sent and received
- **Average Response Time** - bot latency in seconds
- **Average Conversations per Day**
- **Positively Rated / Negatively Rated** messages (when ratings are enabled)

Filter all stats by date range using the date picker or quick presets (Last 7 days, Last 30 days, Last 90 days). Stats refresh instantly without a page reload.

### Activity Chart

An interactive line chart shows conversation and message volume over time - helpful for spotting peaks or drops in chatbot usage.

### Suggestion Statistics

See which preset questions your visitors click most, with usage counts per suggestion.

### Training Data Summary

- Indexed entry count, chunk count, sections, and last training date
- Indexed file count, chunk count, and last indexing date

---

## Chat Logs

Every conversation is stored and fully accessible under **Chatbot → Chat Logs**.

### Session List

Browse all chat sessions in a filterable, paginated table.

**Filter by:**
- Search by session ID
- Rating (All, Positive, Negative)
- Confidence level (High ≥ 80%, Medium 60–79%, Low < 60%, No context)

**Each row shows:**
- Session ID, page URL, message count
- Rating summary (thumbs up / down ratio)
- Color-coded confidence badge
- IP address and timestamp

### Bulk Delete

At the bottom of the logs page, two bulk delete options are available:

- **Delete before date** - select a date and delete all sessions up to and including that day
- **Delete all sessions** - remove the entire log history at once

Both actions require confirmation and cannot be undone.

### Session Detail View

Click any session to see the full conversation.

- Every message shows its role (User or Bot), timestamp, and response time
- Bot messages display a **confidence score badge** (color-coded)
- If the user rated a message, a **thumbs up (green)** or **thumbs down (red)** icon is shown
- Messages used as Q&A training sources are marked with a **"✓ Q&A Training"** badge
- A **"Use as Q&A"** button is available on every bot message - one click creates a new training pair

### Color Grading

Confidence scores are color-coded throughout the log views for instant visual scanning:

| Score | Color | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| ≥ 80% | Green | High confidence - strong context match |
| 60–79% | Yellow | Medium confidence |
| < 60% | Red | Low confidence - weak or partial context |
| - | White | No context used |

---

## Confidence Score

Every bot response is automatically assigned a confidence score between 0 and 1, based on how closely the retrieved context matches the user's question.

- Displayed as a **color-coded percentage** badge on each message
- Visible in the session list and the full session detail view
- Configurable **minimum similarity threshold** (Settings → AI Configuration)
- Low-confidence responses can be reviewed and improved by adding targeted Q&A pairs

---

## Thumb Up / Down User Ratings

Visitors can rate individual bot responses directly in the chat widget.

- Thumbs up / down buttons appear below each bot response (when enabled in Settings → Logging)
- Ratings are stored per message and visible in Chat Logs
- Aggregated rating counts appear in the Dashboard
- Filter Chat Logs by rating to quickly find poorly received answers

---

## Auto-Train on Entry Save

When this feature is enabled (Settings → Training), any entry saved in the Craft Control Panel is automatically indexed in the background - no manual training needed.

- Works for all sections selected for training
- Creates a background queue job on every entry save
- Keeps your chatbot's knowledge current as you update content
- Can be toggled off at any time without losing existing index data

---

## Queue Manager Support

Long training operations (large sitemaps, many entries) run as background jobs via Craft's built-in Queue system.

- Training and crawl jobs are queued automatically
- The UI shows how many jobs were queued and links to **Utilities → Queue**
- No blocking of the Control Panel during processing
- You can continue working while training runs in the background

---

## Settings & Customization

All settings are under **Chatbot → Settings**, organized in tabs.

### General

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Enable Chatbot | Show or hide the widget on the frontend |
| Logo Text | Up to 3 characters, shown as a badge if no logo image is set |
| Logo Image | Square image (min 80×80 px) used as the chat avatar |
| Primary Color | Color for buttons and user message bubbles |
| Logo Background Color | Background color behind the logo in the chat header |
| Default Theme | Start in Light or Dark mode |

### Company

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Company Name | Displayed in the chat header |
| Website URL | The main URL of your website |
| About the Company / Website | Short description of what your company does, its products/services, and target audience |

> Company name, website URL, and description are automatically prepended as a context block to the system prompt so the AI understands who it is representing.

### AI Configuration

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| OpenAI API Key | Required for all AI functions |
| Chat Model | `gpt-4o-mini` (recommended), `gpt-4o`, or `gpt-3.5-turbo` |
| Embedding Model | `text-embedding-3-small` (recommended), `-large`, or `ada-002` |
| Initial Message | The bot's first greeting when the chat opens |
| System Prompt | Full instructions / persona for the AI - define tone, language, scope, restrictions. Pre-filled with a sensible default on first use - edit and save it here in the backend. |
| Max Context Chunks | How many matching text chunks are passed as context (1–20, default 5) |
| Min Similarity Score | Minimum relevance threshold for context retrieval (0.00–1.00, default 0.65) |

> **Note:** Switching the embedding model requires full retraining of all content.

#### Default System Prompt

On a fresh install, the System Prompt field is pre-filled with the contents of `default-prompt.md` (included in the plugin). This gives users a working starting point without having to write a prompt from scratch. Once saved in the backend, the stored value is used exclusively - the file is no longer consulted.

### Training

- Select which Craft sections are included in training
- Enable or disable **Auto-Train on Entry Save**

### Suggestions

- Toggle preset question buttons on or off
- Enter up to 4 preset questions (one per line)
- Questions appear as clickable buttons below the initial greeting

- Enable or disable **Conversation Logging**
